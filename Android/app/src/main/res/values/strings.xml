    <string name="large_text">Delta modulation transmits only one bit per sample. Here, the present sample
value is compared with the previous sample value and this result whether the
amplitude is increased or decreased is transmitted.
• Input signal x(t) is approximated to step signal by the delta modulator. This step
size is kept fixed. The difference between the input signal x(t) and staircase
approximated signal is confined to two levels, i.e., +Δ and -Δ.
• Now, if the difference is positive, then approximated signal is increased by „Δ‟. If
the difference is negative, then approximated signal is reduced by „Δ‟ .
• When the step is reduced, „0‟ is transmitted and when the step is increased, „1‟ is
transmitted.
• Hence, for each sample, only one binary bit is transmitted</string>
